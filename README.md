# zvon-stops

This is a simple script to download (partially yet) [ZVON](http://www.zvon.de) stops as [GTFS-compatible CSV](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/stops-file).

The script uses the following endpoint:

```
http://delfi1.vvo-online.de:8080/delfi3/XSLT_COORD_REQUEST?&jsonp=&boundingBox=&boundingBoxLU={minx}%3A{miny}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&boundingBoxRL={maxx}%3A{maxy}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&coordOutputFormat=WGS84%5BGGZHTXX%5D&type_1=STOP&outputFormat=json&inclFilter=1
```

It starts from bounding box `(13.5, 50.5, 15.5, 52)` and works down to smaller quadrants.

The script produces CSV output in the following format:

```
"stop_id","stop_name","stop_lon","stop_lat","stop_code"
"33003270","Markersbach/Gottleu., Kindertagesstätte",13.9830046808,50.8361016491,"de:14628:3270"
```

# Usage

npm install
node index.js
```
