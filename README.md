# zvon-stops

This is a simple script to download (partially yet) [ZVON](http://www.zvon.de) stops as [GTFS-compatible CSV](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/stops-file).

The script uses the following endpoint:

```
http://delfi1.vvo-online.de:8080/delfi3/XML_STOPLIST_REQUEST?tariffZones=1&coordOutputFormat=WGS84[DD.DDDDD]
```

The script produces CSV output in the following format:

```
stop_id,stop_name,stop_lon,stop_lat,stop_code
"14911006","Kromlau, Kromlau, Waldeisenbahn",14.62798,51.53318,""
```

# Prerequisites

These scrips use PostGIS to filter stops belonging to administrative regions covered by the transport company.  
See [this project](https://github.com/highsource/postgis-verwaltungsgebiete) for a simple way to create a PostGIS database with administrative regions.

# Usage

## Windows

```
npm install
00-export-unfiltered-stops
01-filter-stops
```
